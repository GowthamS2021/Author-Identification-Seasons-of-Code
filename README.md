# Author-Identification-Seasons-of-Code

This repository contains the code and resources collected for the project **Author Identification through Stylometric Analysis**.  In this project, we classify text based on the author. 

# Datasets

Basically, there are 2 approachs for this project, one is without machine learning and other is with machine learning. The datasets that I have used(or I will be using) are dataset of federalist papers for the non-machine learning way, and the sppoky author identification for the machine learning way. 

The resources for the above datasets: 
* [Federalist Papers](https://programminghistorian.org/assets/introduction-to-stylometry-with-python/stylometry-federalist.zip)
* [Spooky-Author-Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spooky-author-identification)

# Timeline
This is the timeline that I have followed till date.(It's not same as the timeline that mentor advised)

1. Week-1 : Learning about NLTK
2. Week-2 : Searching for Data on which ML and Non-ML methods can be appilied
3. Week-3 : Learning the 3 methods and Implementing It
4. Week-4 : Implementing the 3 methods
